# The-Turkish-War-of-Independence
My second custom scenario for the game Rise of Nations

This is my second custom scenario for Rise of Nations: Thrones and Patriots, featuring the Turkish War of Independence(1919-1923)
This scenario is a work of great passion, that I take a lot of pride into.
For the creation of this scenario I had to go through all the game development steps, one by one. 
From the original idea, to doing the historical research of the event. From level design to story telling, from scripting to game testing and balancing.
All these steps resulted in this highly creative and interactive scenario that got a 4.4/5 rating on Heaven Games with over 2.200 downloads.
