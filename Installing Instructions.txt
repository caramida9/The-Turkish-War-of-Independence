Thank you, for downloading my second scenario(Turkish war of independence).

To install it, you will have to do the following simple steps:
1. Extract the folders from the archive, somewhere you can find it easily(I recommend in the game folder);
2. Enter rise of nations(T&P needed);
3. Go to solo game, load scenario, and then go to the folder where you extracted it.
4. Select it, load, play, and then rate or write a comment.(On Heaven Games ofcourse).

I hope you will enjoy it and I hope you will understand my english.

PS: You don't need to extract those 2 maps.I have put them to understand the situation in the beggining and in the end.
